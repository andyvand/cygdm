This directory contains miscellaneous patches that developers may find
useful.

uml_config - People using uml will need to apply this to be able to 
             configure dm.

disable_io_hook - This removes the hooking of the b_end_io field in buffer
                  heads.  suspend/resume of a device will be broken as a
                  result.

instrument_defer - Useful printk's that I use for checking suspend/resume.
