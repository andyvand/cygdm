Apply all of these to the core kernel:
  -mempool.patch            - sct's backport
  -mempool_slab.patch       - a couple more functions
  -vcalloc.patch            - a calloc implementation (with overflow check)

And this one too:
  -b_private.patch          - buffer head changes for ext3 (Andrew Morton)

These patches provide the core driver and implement basic mapping functions:
  -config.patch             - add device-mapper option (tagged experimental)
  -devmapper_only.patch     - the driver, including snapshot support

And for 64-bit architectures:
  -arch64.patch
