    List of projects, ideas and pending bug fixes (no particular order)
   ===============================================

 o Verify that table parsing code is still doing the right thing.

 o Review error message handling

 o Locking on mapped_devices in dm-ioctl.c

 o Check dm_lock_r/w protection on all md use

 o Make table file not lose text for existing table when the device 
   is active and new text is passed in (and otherwise gets ignored)

 o Port to 2.5 kernels (new block I/O layer)

 o Investigate overhead of vmalloc()ed tables and if required look at ways
   of using "normal" kernel memory instead.

 o Add ability to change the blocksize of logical volumes

 o General code tidy

 o Testing, testing, testing....
