    List of projects, ideas and pending bug fixes (no particular order)
   ===============================================

 o Verify that table parsing code is still doing the right thing.

 o Verify ioctl() interface is still working the same way as it used to

 o Error handling in dm-ioctl.c:parse_table()

 o Locking on mapped_devices in dm-ioctl.c

 o Port to 2.5 kernels (new block I/O layer)

 o Investigate char device number allocation for dm-ioctl.c (maybe use misc
   device ?)

 o dm-table.c:dm_table_get_device() only appears to check the sizes when
   allocating new devices

 o Investigate overhead of vmalloc()ed tables and if required look at ways
   of using "normal" kernel memory instead.

 o Add ability to change the blocksize of logical volumes

 o General code tidy

 o Testing, testing, testing....
